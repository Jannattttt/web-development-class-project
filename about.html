        <h1>About Our Journey</h1>
        <p>
            Our FreeCodeCamp journey began thanks to the encouragement of one of our lecturers, who saw potential in us and suggested we explore this incredible platform. 
            They believed FreeCodeCamp would not only strengthen our technical skills but also help us learn how to approach problems collaboratively.
        </p>
        <p>
            At first, the sheer volume of content felt overwhelming, but with the guidance of our lecturer and mutual support as a team, we started making steady progress. 
            Starting with basic HTML and CSS, we gradually built our foundation in web development and moved on to more advanced topics like JavaScript, data structures, and algorithms.
