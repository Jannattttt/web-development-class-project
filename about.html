        <h1>About Our Journey</h1>
        <p>
            I discovered FreeCodeCamp while looking for free resources to learn web development. Initially, I was overwhelmed by the amount of content available, 
            but I soon realized the power of taking small steps each day. Starting with the basics of HTML and CSS, I gradually built my foundation in web development.

            My journey has been marked by moments of doubt and frustration, especially while learning JavaScript. However, each hurdle I overcame made me more confident in my abilities.
            The hands-on projects, such as building a personal portfolio and JavaScript calculators, have been game changers for me.
