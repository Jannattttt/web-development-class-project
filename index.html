        <h1>Welcome to Our FreeCodeCamp Journey</h1>
        <p>
            Hello and welcome to our personal website! Together, we embarked on a journey with FreeCodeCamp, and it has been one of the most rewarding experiences for us. 
            From knowing almost nothing about coding to building real-world projects as a team, every step has been full of challenges, growth, and collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
            This site reflects our shared journey. Here, you'll learn more about how we got started, the milestones we’ve achieved, and what’s next for us as developers.
            Whether you’re fellow learners or simply curious about our progress, we hope you’ll find inspiration and insights here.

            <h2>Why We Chose FreeCodeCamp</h2>
            <p>
                FreeCodeCamp stood out to us because of its structured curriculum, practical projects, and a supportive community. It offered the perfect platform 
                to learn web development for free while also gaining hands-on experience in a collaborative setting.
            </p>
            <p>
                The journey hasn’t been easy, but the rewards have been worth it. We’ve not only gained technical skills but also developed teamwork and problem-solving
                abilities that will help us tackle real-world projects.
