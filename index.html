        <h1>Welcome to My FreeCodeCamp Journey</h1>
        <p>
            Hello and welcome to my personal website! I started my coding journey with FreeCodeCamp, and it has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. 
            From knowing almost nothing about coding to building real-world projects, every step has been full of challenges and growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            This site is a reflection of that journey. Here, you'll learn more about how I got started, the milestones I've achieved, and what's next on my path as a developer.
            Whether you're a fellow learner or someone curious about my progress, I hope you find inspiration here.

            <h2>Why I Chose FreeCodeCamp</h2>
            <p>
                FreeCodeCamp stood out because of its structured curriculum, practical projects, and a supportive community. It offered the perfect platform to learn 
                web development for free while also gaining hands-on experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                The journey hasn't been easy, but the rewards have been worth it. Iâ€™ve not only gained technical skills but also the confidence to tackle problems and 
                contribute to open-source projects.
