        <h1>Our Milestones</h1>
        <p>
            Looking back at our FreeCodeCamp journey, we’re proud of how far we’ve come as a team. None of this would have been possible without the guidance of our lecturer, who encouraged us to take on challenges and celebrate every small victory along the way.

            <h2>Key Milestones</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>First Steps:</strong> Completing our very first HTML and CSS projects was a significant moment for us. It showed us that coding could be fun and rewarding when approached as a team.</li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript Basics:</strong> Learning JavaScript felt like a steep climb, but with patience and teamwork, we managed to grasp core concepts like variables, loops, and functions.</li>
                <li><strong>Responsive Web Design Certification:</strong> Earning our first FreeCodeCamp certification was a game-changer. It boosted our confidence and motivated us to dive deeper into web development.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaborative Projects:</strong> Working on team projects, such as building a landing page or a portfolio site, helped us learn how to merge individual skills into a cohesive output.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
            <p>
                While we’ve accomplished a lot, we know this is just the beginning. Our goal is to continue building our skills, exploring more advanced topics, and creating meaningful projects that showcase our growth as developers.
                We’re grateful for the journey so far and excited about what lies ahead!
